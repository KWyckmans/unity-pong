# Pong in unity

Wanting to learn unity, I decided to write a very basic implementation of pong as one of the first projects to get to
know the engine.

The code is primarily based on [Creating a pong clone in Unity](http://unity.grogansoft.com/beginners-guide-create-a-pong-clone-in-unity-part-1/)
and [Pong in unity](https://github.com/ainc/unity-pong).
